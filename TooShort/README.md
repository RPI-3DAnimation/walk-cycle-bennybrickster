# Walk

Create Two Walks using Monty (the "Ball with Legs") rig or a rig of your choice: one "Vanilla walk" and one "Walk with Personality". 

The walks should be based on your own reference video and analysis, but should be adapted for the character you are animating.  You can also shoot your reference video with the character in mind - think about that character's personality, how you would imagine them walking, and act that out when shooting your reference. 

The "Personality Walk" should include more personality and emotion. Think about all the different ways you can walk: cautious, sneaky, jaunty, sassy, melancholy, angry, happy, pensive, scared, etc.  You can think of the walk as a piece out of a story: where is the character going, and why?  Are they trying to get somewhere, or away from something?  Are they doing something else while walking? What else is going through their mind? 

For each of the two walks, shoot reference video, do thumbnail and planning sketches, and animate.

Preparation:

Reference video: shoot reference video of both the side view and the front view.
Key poses: draw thumbnail sketches of the key poses, paying attention to balance, weight shifts, rotation of the hips and body in addition to the position of the feet and the pose of the leg
Timing thumbnails: draw thumbnails in side view of the key poses with frame numbers.  
Performance notes: reference video doesn't show you everything. Perform the walk again, being mindful of your movements.  Make notes on your thumbnail sheet of any weight shifts or details to the movement weren't evident in the reference. 

Animation:

Animate the walk, and turn in your preparation materials and Playblasts.

For both the Vanilla and the Personality Walk, how the same walk from three camera angles: 3/4 view, side, and front.  

All playblasts can be combined into one video or submitted as multiple files. 

Quicktime or MP4
H.264 or MPEG-4 Compression
Resolution: 1280x720
FPS: 24

Include the frame counter in the playblast

Due: 11/10, at the beginning of class.  We will have an in-class critique.
